# Diary Sentiment Analyzer
A sentiment analyzer for your diary using VADER. This program prompts you for a path to your diary, sends them through VADER one by one, and then scores them based on sentiment. It then returns a count of positive, negative and neutral entries, thereby allowing you to get a sense of what your days are like. All entries must be in `.md` format.

## Usage
```bash
python vader_diary.py
```
